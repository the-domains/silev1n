  The heavy rain did not stop us from enjoying the island. A long walk through
  the mangrove, took us to a beach with some crabs playing hide and seek in the
  sand. After the beach an observatory deck to watch the cloud playing over the
  hills, and listen to the Rasputin bird. An old man drinking his rum in front
  of the river. A couple from the posh hotel next door asking if there is an art
  exhibition at the end of the mangrove walk. @natgeotravel @nytimestravel
