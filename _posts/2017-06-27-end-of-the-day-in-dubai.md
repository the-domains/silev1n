End of the day in Dubai!
![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/b65a2046650068de2615caea3fa80ae8/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.cdninstagram.com%2Ft51.2885-15%2Fs640x640%2Fsh0.08%2Fe35%2F19051479_243492739467938_2885290206896848896_n.jpg)

After the heat of the day, an inviting cool breeze allow a walk in the desert. As usual the sun does his show, setting over Al Quadra Lake, firing the sky of mesmerizing colors, and the spirit wonder on an empty stomach. 

Behind me, there is Bab Al Shams palace, a hidden jewel only minutes from the city, facing the Desert from where you can observe the fauna around the infinity pool. 

A place like no others in Dubai where the stars are brighter, the sky darker, and where you feel like an adventurer resting in an Oasis after a long walk in the desert. 

The palace is getting ready to host the hundred of guests expected to break their fast at sunset. 

A bit later, while the sun is behind the horizon, you can hear the call to the prayer from the muezzin, echoing in the distance, the dog bark, and the birds take off at once. It is time to eat and relieve our empty stomach. 

This is Iftar, this is Ramadan !
