Al Qudra lakes / slow shutter / 5 minutes to Iftar. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/d4a9355a01d16e892463ba9b583a1668/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.cdninstagram.com%2Ft51.2885-15%2Fs640x640%2Fsh0.08%2Fe35%2F19227257_142392129656853_2224611704333926400_n.jpg)

Another walk at sunset, this place became our oasis in the middle of Seih Al Salam desert, where we go when we want to escape from the city. 

Behind the tree, across the lake there is the al Qudra cycle path, a dedicated 85km cycling area, initiative of @hhshkmohd. Great place to train for \#Ironman. 

Some says you could spot the famous G-wagon with the "1" number plate, and that if you are lucky enough the man himself would come to offer you some coffee!
